# Congress Classifier

This project explores how a representativeâ€™s voting patterns on
key issues can determine the ideology of said representative.
We will use 16 key votes as determined by the Congressional
Quarterly Almanac and learn how to associate the voting records
to classify representatives as either being a Democrat or a
Republican.

## Dependencies

The code is written in Python 3 using the `numpy` and `matplotlib`
libraries, with `seaborn` being used in `exp3.py` for better
color palettes for the graphs.

## Data

This project uses the congressional voting records from Volume
XL of the Congressional Quarterly Almanac that includes votes
for each member of the U.S. House of Representative on 16 key
issues. This data set was retrieved from the[UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Congressional+Voting+Records).
Each representative is represented by a vector with the first
element being either "democrat" or "republican" and the rest
being either "y," "n," or "?," corresponding to a yes vote, no
vote, or other respectively for the 16 votes. To process the
data, for each representative I made it's label "1" if they are
a democrat or "-1" if they are a republican.

For the vote features, there is an interesting minor complication
on how to represent the disposition. If the vote data only
consists of yes votes and no votes, it would be simple to just
do a binary encoding of the vote, with 1 being yes and 0 being
no. However, we also have the other vote, represented by a "?"
in the original data. To deal with this, I made the feature "1"
for "y," "-1" for "n," and "0" for "?." That way, intuitively we
have a no vote having an appropriate negative affect, a yes vote
having an appropriate positive affect, and an other vote having
a neutral affect, neither positive or negative.

For further use, we stored the classification labels as an CSV
file named "labels.csv" and the feature vectors as a CSV file
named "data.csv" which is found in the `data\` directory.

## Methods

This repository currently contains code for L2 logistic regression
with gradient descent, L2 logistic regression with stochastic
gradient descent (batch size 1), L2 logistic regression with
stochastic gradient descent (batch size 50), and LASSO least
squares regression with coordinate descent.

## Experiments

The experiment code are labeled `exp#.py`, where "#" refers to
the experiment number. This repository currently contains 3
such experiments. Experiment 1 looked at the average
misclassification errors for the 4 methods mentioned above.
Experiment 2 looked at hyperparameter settings for LASSO least
squares regression with coordinate descent. Experiment 3 looked
at the weights as the lambda value for LASSO least squares
regression with coordinate descent changed.
